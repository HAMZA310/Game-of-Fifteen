PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Game of Fifteen is a challenging game. The idea of Game of Fifteen is not new; it
has mesmerized mathematical geniuses for centuries and it will mesmerize you today.
In this puzzle, user has to arrange tiles of randomly assorted numbers in ascending
order. 

1- Game of Fifteen has variable difficulty levels (3 to 9)
2- To solve Game of Fifteen, you will have to arrange tiles, initially placed randomly, in ascending order.
3- Enter the number of tile from keyboard and that tile will move to "empty space".

4- ONE TILE AT A TIME, ADJACENT TO EMPTY SPACE, IS MOVEABLE.

5- A tile can neither jump over other tiles nor it can move diagonally to empty space. 
6- To make things juicier, I decided to limit user's number of moves in "MASTER MODE" only. 
   Total number of available moves in "MASTER MDOE" should, of course, depend on difficulty level (3 - 9).
7- Lastly, I decided to save user's all moves in a txt file (this feature is intended for users not too naive.)
